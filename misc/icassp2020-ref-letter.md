To whom it may concern,

I write on behalf of Jui-Yang Hsu's application for ICASSP 2020 travel grant. He is the first author of the paper "Meta Learning for End-to-End Low-Resource Speech Recognition". 

I have been Jui-Yang’s advisor at National Taiwan University (NTU) for four years as he was an undergraduate researcher. Jui-Yang graduated from the department of Electrical Engineering at NTU, and he is a 2-year Master student in my research team. Jui-Yang published one paper related to spoken question answering in SLT 2016 during his bachelor career and took many machine-learning-related courses, including theoretical ones and practical ones in speech and natural language processing.

After he got his bachelor degree, he was exchanged to KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden for 10 months. Then, he interned in the NLP team in Apple Inc. for 3 months during 2018 summer and was given highly complimentary remarks by his mentor. When he started pursuing his master degree since the October of 2018, he also served as the network administrator in my research team, maintaining the computation cluster and developing useful features to accelerate the research efficiency for whole team. Therefore, I believe he  has not only great potential in this area but also fluent communication skills.

The motivation of the paper published in ICASSP is to utilize meta learning approach into low-resource speech-related applications. The goal of meta learning is to solve the problem “fast adaptation on unseen data”, which is aligned with the low-resource setting. It has gained some initial success in image classification under few-shot scenario, but not in multilingual pretraining in speech recognition. This paper showed its potential experimentally and provided novel research direction to the community. 

In sum, I highly recommend Jui-Yang for the ICASSP 2020 travel grant. I believe if he could attend ICASSP to discuss with other researchers about his work, not only he can learn different aspects from the experts, but also others can gain some inspirations on their own works.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
